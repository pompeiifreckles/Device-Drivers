-> Current Process
  Kernel code can refer to the current process by accessing the global item current defined in <asm/current.h>,
  which yields a pointer to struct task_struct, defined in <linux/sched.h>

  printk(KERN_INFO "The process is \"%s\" (pid %i)\n", current->comm, current->pid);

  current->comm   base name of the program
  current->pid    process id
