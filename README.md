# Device Drivers

## Why I am writing this?
Because I like dealing with system level programs and what can be better than fiddling with the kernel itself.

## How I am writing this?
My experience in this is fairly limited, in other words I am noob.\
But that is just another reason to why I wrote this.\
This is in no way complete and you shouldn't rely on this solely to write drivers.\
This is my own interpretation of the Kernel Device Drivers _written by Greg Kroah Hartman_.\
This repo also serves the purpose of documenting my own progress and noting the updated methods not yet available in the book.\

## I want to write drivers, where do I start?
Visit [kernel newbies](https://kernelnewbies.org/), it's got a lot of resources listed there.\
Read the book "Kernel Device Drivers" _by Greg Kroah Hartman_.\
Connect with maintainers over IRC.
